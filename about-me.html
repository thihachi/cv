    <h1>About me</h1>
    <p>My name is Thiha Kaung Sett. I am born and raised in Myanmar and am currently an undergraduate student in Hong Kong.</p>
    <p>I have been studying accounting for nearly 7 years now. And my career goal is to enter the Hong Kong finance industry because I want to use the knowledge I gain in the sector to make a valuable contribution back in my country in the future.</p>
    <p>I am also very passionate in startup businesses. I love to find out real world probelms and think about solutions, build these solutions and then sell it.</p>
